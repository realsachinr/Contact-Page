# React + Vite

This project uses ReactJS to build a Contact Us page. In ReactJS, we break down the page into small pieces called components, like building blocks. Each component does a specific job, such as showing the header, contact form. We use props to customize these components easily, like passing in different contact information. This makes the page dynamic and interactive without reloading. The goal is to make a user-friendly Contact Us page that's easy to build and update.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
